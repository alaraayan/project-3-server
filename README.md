## Overview 
This was our second to last project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course. As a group we were tasked with building a full-stack application of our choice.

Inspired by the amount of time we spent on Netflix trying to find something to watch only to choose the wrong movie, we decided sometimes indexing movies based on their genre was just not enough. Moodflix is centered around choosing movies based on your current mood.

## Brief
The brief given was to:
* **Build a full-stack application** - by making your own backend and your own front-end.
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from the Mongo database.
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React.
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut.
* **Have a visually impressive design**. 
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Key Learnings
<p>One of the biggest takeaways I have from this project is how important communication and collaboration is when working in a team. We worked really well together and I believe it made the entire week so much more enjoyable. 

We always knew what everyone was doing and although we worked solo most of the time, we checked in with each other regularly and made sure we spent most of the day on Zoom to create a collaborative environment. This helped us when we had problems, we would ask for help a lot sooner. We would start in the morning with a mini standup and finish every day with setting up tasks for everyone. This project was also the first time we used Git branching and to minimise the issues that may arise we always merged together -we affectionately called these Merge Parties-. 

Another crucial aspect I believe was the planning. Chloe has experience working as a project manager and that helped tremendously to keep things organised with tools like Trello. This was the first GA project where I learnt how to work on different branches and resolve merge conflicts together using Git.

But the biggest lesson I learned during this project is to not be afraid to alter my code. I realised, intrinsically I tend to alter my code rather than take a step back and rethink my approach. The moods and editing a movie functionality really taught me how to check with myself whether I need a new angle or not and I find this incredibly valuable.</p>

## Future Features

If we had more time on this project we would add:
- Responsiveness
- Ability to like a movie 
- User profile page
