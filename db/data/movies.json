When a child, Chiron lives with his single, crack addict mother Paula in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami. Chiron is a shy, withdrawn child largely due to his small size and being neglected by his mother, who is more concerned about getting her fixes and satisfying her carnal needs than taking care of him. Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. Besides his same aged Cuban-American friend Kevin, Chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named Juan, who can see that he is neglected, and Juan's caring girlfriend Teresa, whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from Paula's abuse. With this childhood as a foundation, Chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms of its problems when he reaches his difficult teen years when peer pressure affects what he and many of his peers do, unless he follows Juan's advice of truly making his own decisions for himself.","language":["English"],"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQxNTIyODAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQyMDA3OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"source":"Internet Movie Database","value":"7.4/10"},{"source":"Rotten Tomatoes","value":"98%"},{"source":"Metacritic","value":"99/100"}],"moods":["intense","thought-provoking"]},{"title":"The Tree of Life","year":"2011","rated":"PG-13","released":"17 May 2011","runtime":"139 min","genres":["Drama","Fantasy"],"director":["Terrence Malick"],"actors":["Brad Pitt","Sean Penn","Jessica Chastain","Hunter McCracken"],"plot":"The impressionistic story of a Texas family in the 1950s.

The condition of the release includes Pat Jr. moving back in with his parents in their Philadelphia home. Although Pat Jr.'s institutionalization was due to him beating up the lover of his wife Nikki, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nikki has since left him and has received a restraining order against him. Although he is on medication (which he doesn't take because of the way it makes him feel) and has mandatory therapy sessions, Pat Jr. feels like he can manage on the outside solely by healthy living and looking for the \"silver linings\" in his life. His goals are to get his old job back as a substitute teacher, but more importantly reunite with Nikki. He finds there are certain instances where he doesn't cope well, however no less so than some others who have never been institutionalized, such as his Philadelphia Eagles obsessed father who has resorted to being a bookie to earn a living, his best friend Ronnie who quietly seethes over the control wielded by his wife Veronica, and Veronica's widowed sister, Tiffany Maxwell, a girl with problems of her own. In their fragile mental states, Pat Jr. and Tiffany embark on a love/hate friendship based primarily on what help the other can provide in achieving their individual goals. But they may reevaluate their goals as their relationship progresses.","language":["English"],"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MTI5NzA3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExNTc0OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"source":"Internet Movie Database","value":"7.7/10"},{"source":"Rotten Tomatoes","value":"92%"},{"source":"Metacritic","value":"81/100"}],"moods":["heart-warming","uplifting","romantic"]},{"title":"Project X","year":"2012","rated":"R","released":"02 Mar 2012","runtime":"88 min","genres":["Comedy"],"director":["Nima Nourizadeh"],"actors":["Thomas Mann","Oliver Cooper","Jonathan Daniel Brown","Dax Flame"],"plot":"It's Thomas Kub's 17th birthday and all he wants to do is throw a small party with some friends to help raise his social status and maybe even get lucky.
